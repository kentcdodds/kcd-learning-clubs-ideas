## FAQ:

### What constitutes "curriculum?"

Anything that a group of people could go through together (whether
synchronously, asynchronously, or a mix of the two). Including things like:

- Online courses
- Books
- Tutorials
- Podcasts
- Workshop material

What's important is that it's something that you can actually create a schedule
for and have some "learning activities" you can participate in together or
discuss.
